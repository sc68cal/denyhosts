To use these plugins, you will need to do three things:

1. Add the following two lines to your PF config file (usually /etc/pf.conf):

table <denyhosts> persist file "/var/db/denyhosts"
block drop in log quick from <denyhosts> to any

This configuration will will cause PF to silently drop any connection coming
from a host that DenyHosts has identified as an offender.

2. Create the empty persistence file:

touch /var/db/denyhosts

3. Add the pf_add.py to denyhosts.cfg in the PLUGIN_DENY entry and
pf_remove.py as the PLUGIN_PURGE entry. You will need to make sure these
plugin scripts are executable and that the path to python is correct.
